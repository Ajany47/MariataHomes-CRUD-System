# 💻 Mariata Homes CRUD System – System Design & Development

This project showcases a fully documented CRUD system designed for **Mariata Homes**, a UK-based charity providing subsidized accommodation. The solution was developed as part of a postgraduate coursework submission for the *System Design & Development* module at the **University of Greenwich**.

## 📘 Project Summary

Mariata Homes sought to transition from a manual, paper-based registration system to a structured digital platform. The resulting prototype demonstrates:

- User registration and login  
- Admin dashboard with full CRUD operations  
- Normalized database schema (up to 3NF)  
- Front-end forms for user input and accommodation requests  
- Comprehensive documentation including ERD, UML, and UI flows
