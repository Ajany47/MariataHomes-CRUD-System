💻 Mariata Homes CRUD System – System Design & Development
This project showcases a fully documented CRUD system designed for Mariata Homes, a UK-based charity providing subsidized accommodation. The solution was developed as part of a postgraduate coursework submission for the System Design & Development module at the University of Greenwich.

User registration and login

Admin dashboard with full CRUD operations

Normalized database schema (up to 3NF)

Front-end forms for user input and accommodation requests

Comprehensive documentation including ERD, UML, and UI flows
